			h1 What is What Went Well?
			p The exercise itself is simple: "Write down three things that went well today and why they went well." You can do the exercise on your own, but we've experienced the most profound effects by performing the exercise in a supportive, collaborative group. 

			h1 How do the video chats work?
			p We will meet via Google Hangout video chat once a week for one month. All you need is a webcam and a Google+/gmail account. Hangouts are 45 minutes long. The video chat is the heart of the practice, where each person shares 2 What Went Wells for the day. The facilitators ensure a space where everyone feels safe to share whatever they like.

			p Each day you will be asked to post one What Went Well to a private Google Group. This can be as much or as little as you’d like. It is a small commitment that keeps the practice alive between weekly video chats, and helps you get the most out of the 30 day program.
