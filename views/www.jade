					span.lead-text What Went Well
					| is a simple positive psychology exercise introduced in Martin Seligman's book, "Flourish". It is an evidence-based exercise proven to increase wellbeing. The exercise itself is simple: "Write down three things that went well today and why they went well." You can do the exercise on your own, but we've experienced the most profound effects by performing the exercise in a supportive, collaborative group. 

				p Through Google Hangouts, we can make this possible to anyone. We are creating this online support group to share this amazing exercise with those who wish to commit to this practice and get the support they need to make it a successful part of their lives.

				h1 How does the group work?
				p We will meet via Google Hangout video chat once a week for one month. All you need is a webcam and a Google+/gmail account. Hangouts are 45 minutes long. The video chat is the heart of the practice, where each person shares 2 What Went Wells for the day. The video format gives everyone a chance to be out in the open and create an intimate environment even if we are thousands of miles away! The facilitators ensure a safe space in which nobody is pressured to share anything other than what they are inspired to share.

				p Each day you will be asked to post one What Went Well to a private Google Group. This can be as much or as little as you’d like. It is a small commitment that keeps the practice alive between weekly video chats, and helps you get the most out of the 30 day program.
